\section{Desirable properties of a cryptocurrency system} % Don't be this informal in your notes!
For a cryptocurrency system to be practical and usable, it should meet the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Secure:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Theft:} Only owner should be able to spend the money, and no one else.
		\item \textbf{Consensus:} If money is spent, everybody should agree.
		In other words, all the parties must agree to the order of transactions that have taken place in the system.
		Also, no money can be double spent.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Distributed:} The transaction log is distributed among all the parties using the system.
	\item \textbf{Anonymity:} Only transactions are public, but not the identities of the sender, or the receiver.
	\item \textbf{Scalable:} Achieves high throughput in terms of the number of transactions executed per unit time.
	\item \textbf{Efficient:} The storage space required to store the transaction log, and the bandwidth and the processing power required to execute the distributed protocol should be optimal.
	\item \textbf{Fault tolerance:} Should be resilient to network interruptions, or faulty, or adversarial nodes.
	\item \textbf{Fairness:} Like in any trade, the payer receives~\cite{1} the item/service she has paid for.
\end{itemize}


\section{The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) -- Revisited}
The Byzantine Generals Problem allegorically models a fundamental problems in the distributed systems where $n$ nodes need to come to a consensus under the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Authenticated channel:} Receivers know the source of the message they receive.
	\item \textbf{Bad actors:} There are $f$ bad actors present in the system who try to either break the consistency of the system, or its availability.
	\item \textbf{Delay:} Message delays are unbounded, \textit{i.e.}, the network may be unreliable.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
	It is impossible to solve the problem unless $3f + 1 \leq n$.
	In other words, in a synchronous network with authenticated channel where $f$ actors are corrupt, no solution will work unless there are more than 3f actors present in the network. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Proving impossibility by example}
Let's assume $n=3$ actors with $f=1$ corrupt actor want to agree on a bit $b \in \{0,1\}$.
Table~\ref{tab:bgp_impossbility_proof1} and Table~\ref{tab:bgp_impossbility_proof2} show the bits sent and received by different actors.
Actor \textbf{B} is dishonest.
In the first case, it sends bit $0$ to \textbf{A}, and bit $1$ to \textbf{C}.
Therefore, \textbf{A} and \textbf{C} agree on different bits---$0$ and $1$ respectively.
In the seconds case, it sends no message at all---thus preventing \textbf{A} and \textbf{C} reach any consensus.
Either one breaks the consistency of the system.

\subsection{Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)}
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a leader based, two-round protocol for the Byzantine Generals Problem.
Let's assume there are $n$ actors of which $f$ are corrupt, where $3f + 1 \leq n$.
The steps of the algorithm are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Some leader proposes a transaction $T$ by broadcasting it to others
	\item When machine $x$ hears the transaction $T$, it acknowledges the receipt by broadcasting $\texttt{ACK}(x, T)$
	\item When machine $y$ hears quorum of $\texttt{ACK}(x, T)$, it acknowledges the receipt by broadcasting $\texttt{ACK}(y, \text{quorum of } \texttt{ACK}(x, T))$.
	A \textit{quorum} is defined as $2f + 1$ acknowledgment messages $\texttt{ACK}(x, T)$ for the same transaction $T$
	\item When machine $z$ hears $\texttt{ACK}(y, \text{quorum of } \texttt{ACK}(x, T))$, it knows $T$ is committed
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{PBFT by example}
Let's assume there are $n=4$ actors out of which $f=1$ are corrupt.
Therefore, quorum ($2f + 1$) is $3$ messages/actor.
There actors are $\{x-1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}$.
We assume the leader is \textit{not} dishonest.
Let $x_2$ be the bad actor here.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Round 0 (Proposal): } $x_2$ proposes a transaction $T$.
	$x_i$, where $i \in \{1, 3, 4\}$, listens to this broadcast
	\item \textbf{Round 1: } $x_i$ acknowledges the receipt by broadcasting $\texttt{ACK}(x_i, T)$, where $i \in \{1, 3, 4\}$
	\item \textbf{Round 2: } $x_i$ re-acknowledges the acknowledgment messages from the round $1$ by broadcasting $\texttt{ACK}(x_i, \texttt{ACK}(\{x_j\}, T))$, where $i, j \in \{1, 3, 4\}$
	\item \textbf{Finalization:} $x_i$, where $i \in \{1, 3, 4\}$, commits to $T$
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Decentralized BFT}
PBFT can't be applied naively to a decentralized setting like cryptocurrency system because of the following issues:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The number of actors $n$ is not known before the protocol is executed.
	Moreover, $n$ changes dynamically as nodes are free to join or leave the network at any time.
	\item The complexity of PBFT is $O(n^2)$.
	In a practical system, $n$ could be huge.
	For example, if there are $1$ million nodes present in the network, approximately $1$ trillion messages are exchanged.
\end{itemize}

The idea is to fairly sample $n^\prime \subset n$ nodes to bring the final complexity down to $O(nn^\prime)$.
Speaking of \textit{fairness}, different protocols adapt different sampling strategies.
In Bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus protocol proposes a technique called \textit{proof-of-work} that regulates a machine's power in the system as a function of its computational power.
In other words, the more processing power a machine has, it has got more power in the system.
However, \textit{proof-of-work} is resource demanding, hence not very efficient.
\textit{Proof-of-stake} is a viable alternative that regulates a machine's power in the system as a function of the money being held in the account.
