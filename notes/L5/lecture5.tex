% This is a borrowed LaTeX template file for lecture notes for CS267,
% Applications of Parallel Computing, UCBerkeley EECS Department.
% Now being used for CMU's 10725 Fall 2012 Optimization course
% taught by Geoff Gordon and Ryan Tibshirani.  When preparing 
% LaTeX notes for this class, please use this template.
%
% To familiarize yourself with this template, the body contains
% some examples of its use.  Look them over.  Then you can
% run LaTeX on this file.  After you have LaTeXed this file then
% you can look over the result either by printing it out with
% dvips or using xdvi. "pdflatex template.tex" should also work.

\section{Desirable properties of a cryptocurrency system} % Don't be this informal in your notes!
For a cryptocurrency system to be practical and usable, it should meet the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Secure:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Theft:} Only owner should be able to spend the money, and no one else.
		\item \textbf{Consensus:} If money is spent, everybody should agree.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Distributed:} The transaction log is distributed among all the parties using the system.
	\item \textbf{Anonymity:} Only transactions are public, but not the identities of the sender, or the receiver.
	\item \textbf{Scalable:} Achieves high throughput in terms of the number of transactions executed per unit time.
	\item \textbf{Efficient:} The storage space required to store the transaction log, and the bandwidth and the processing power required to execute the distributed protocol should be optimal.
	\item \textbf{Fault tolerance:} Should be resilient to network interruptions, or faulty, or adversarial nodes.
	\item \textbf{Fairness:} Like in any trade, the payer receives~\cite{1} the item/service she has paid for.
\end{itemize}
